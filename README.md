# Medical-Insurance-Prediction-Model-using-FNN
Feedforward Neural Networks Model for Medical Insurance Costs in R

In this project, we developed a regression-based deep learning model using a feedforward neural network (FNN) to predict insurance charges based on key customer attributes such as age, BMI, smoking status, region, and more. We performed comprehensive data preprocessing including factor encoding, one-hot encoding, normalization, and train-test splitting to ensure optimal model performance.

The model was trained and evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE) and loss metrics. The final MAE of approximately 3966 indicates the model can predict insurance costs with a reasonable level of accuracy. The training and validation loss curves demonstrate smooth convergence, suggesting the model generalizes well to unseen data without overfitting.

This predictive model holds strong business value for insurance providers. It can be leveraged to:
	•	Accurately estimate individual premiums,
	•	Perform customer risk assessment,
	•	Forecast future claim expenses, and
	•	Aid in designing personalized insurance products.

With proper integration into a data pipeline and periodic retraining, this model can serve as a powerful tool for enhancing data-driven decision-making in the insurance industry.
